# books
books database in laravel


The challenge was to learn something on the go. It did not take long. Laravel is super awesome, easy, eloquent, clean really with perfect 

documentation.

To get this up and running 

git clone

cd into it

install compose dependencies/npm

cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate

I have seed
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed


Because seed creates latin based data, I had to enter some data via Table plus - that is when you see the searchable does a decent job at finding info.
